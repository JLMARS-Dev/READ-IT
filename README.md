Our application is currently locally host. To run it on your device, you must first clone the repository
to your preferred IDE. We recommend VS Code.
Once you have opened the folder on VS Code, open a new terminal and split the terminal.
Use the command #`cd client` on the first terminal and #`cd server` on the second terminal. Run the 
command npm i on both terminals.

Once it has finished installing missing dependencies, you use the command #`npm start` on both 
terminals to start the application.
*Note that you need to have nodejs installed for the application to run.
